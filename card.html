			<p>Their size and the bluntness of their heads lead these dolphins to often be mistaken for porpoises.
				 The head is coloured a dark grey. The front half of the upper side and the flanks are a much lighter grey.
				 The dorsal fin, fluke and back half of the back are again a darker grey colour.
				 The underbelly is white, with flashes of white on the flanks below the dorsal fin.

				 Males reach sexual maturity at about seven to 9 years. Females reach breeding age at the same time.
				 The gestation period is probably 10 months. Mating occurs in spring and summer.
				 Females are believed to calve on average once every three years.</p>
